# igeek/utilities

## Introduction

`igeek/utilities` is a collection of utilities helpful when writing code for WordPress. It is a fork of the `g3/utilities` package that I wrote in 2022. The future of that package is uncertain (I have no visibility regarding that). Going forward `igeek/utilities` will be maintained by me. Pull Requests, bug reports, feature requests are always welcome.

On its own this package does not do anything; hence this is not available as a WordPress plugin. It is meant to be used as a support/utility library for existing/new WordPress code, be it theme or plugin.

## License

This package is licensed under `GPL v2.0-or-later`. You are free to use this package however you like as long as you comply with the terms of the license.

## Requirements

This composer package has following requirements for use:

- **PHP >= 8.2** : This package was written for PHP 8.2.x and uses some features which might not be available in lower versions.
- **WordPress** : Some of the functionality in this package uses WordPress functions. This package is not meant to be used without WordPress and there are no plans of adding/supporting polyfills for those functions to make this package work without WordPress. If you want to use this package without WordPress, you are free to do so and add any polyfills you might need.

## Installation

This is a `composer` package and to use it, you should install `composer` and fetch it through that. That way you would be able to easily have control over which version you use and `composer` would take care of any dependencies this package might have.

Once you have `composer` installed, run the following command in your project directory.

```bash
composer require igeek/utilities
```

Once the package is installed, put the following in your project code before you use any of the package API. If you are not adding this in a file which resides in the same directory as your `composer.json` file or `vendor` directory then adjust the path below accordingly.

```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```
This will allow you to use this package's API (& that of any other `composer` package you install) without bothering about loading up package files.
